# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing airline-related tweets to classify customer sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). By leveraging various machine learning models and natural language processing techniques, the project aims to help airlines better understand customer feedback and improve their services.

---

## Project Objectives

* **Classify sentiments** expressed in airline tweets.
* Compare multiple machine learning models to find the most effective approach.
* Visualize model performance through evaluation metrics and plots.

---

## Dataset

* The dataset used is **`airline.csv`**, containing tweets about airlines labeled with sentiments.
* It includes text data that represents real customer opinions, making it ideal for NLP-based sentiment analysis.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Libraries

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy** ‚Äî Data handling and manipulation
* **Scikit-learn** ‚Äî Machine learning models and evaluation
* **NLTK** ‚Äî Natural language preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** ‚Äî Data visualization

---

## Data Preprocessing

* **Tokenization**: Breaking down tweets into individual words.
* **Stopword removal**: Eliminating common words (e.g., "and", "the") to focus on meaningful words.
* **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base form (e.g., "delayed" ‚Üí "delay").
* **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converting text data into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning models.

---

## Machine Learning Models

The following models were implemented and compared:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
* **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**

---

## üìä Model Evaluation

To evaluate and compare model performance, several metrics were used:

* **Accuracy Score**: Overall prediction correctness.
* **Classification Report**: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
* **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of true vs. predicted classes.
* **ROC AUC Score**: Ability of the model to distinguish between classes.
* **ROC Curves**: Graphical visualization of the true positive rate vs. false positive rate.

---

## Visualizations

* Heatmaps of confusion matrices to easily interpret misclassifications.
* ROC curves to compare model performance visually.

---

##  Key Findings

* Multiple models were trained and evaluated, with detailed performance metrics.
* Preprocessing significantly improved model performance by cleaning and transforming text data.
* Visualizations provide intuitive insights into how each model performs, helping identify strengths and weaknesses.
